# Simple_Cues_ReID

An implementation of the ReID portion of the [Simple Cues Lead to a Strong Multi-Object Tracker (2022) ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04656.pdf) paper which doesn't have an implementation currently. 

The tracking portion of this paper will be added to my [MOT project](https://github.com/ak-tiwary/MOT_from_Scratch). I have included some additional training tricks from the now standard [Bag of tricks for ReID paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07071.pdf) in addition to the ones already used by the Simple Cues paper.
