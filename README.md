# Simple_Cues_ReID

An implementation of the ReID portion of the [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04656.pdf](Simple Cues Lead to a Strong Multi-Object Tracker paper) which doesn't have an implementation currently. The tracking portion will be added to my [https://github.com/ak-tiwary/MOT_from_Scratch](MOT project). I have included training tricks from the now standard [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07071.pdf](Bag of tricks for ReID paper).
